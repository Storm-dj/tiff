/* Field type definitions
From [TIFF6]:
	1  = BYTE	8-bit unsigned integer.
	2  = ASCII	8-bit byte that contains a 7-bit ASCII code; the last byte must be NUL (binary zero).
	3  = SHORT	16-bit (2-byte) unsigned integer.
	4  = LONG	32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer.
	5  = RATIONAL	Two LONGs: the first represents the numerator of a fraction; the second, the denominator.
	6  = SBYTE	An 8-bit signed (twos-complement) integer.
	7  = UNDEFINED	An 8-bit byte that may contain anything, depending on the definition of the field.
	8  = SSHORT	A 16-bit (2-byte) signed (twos-complement) integer.
	9  = SLONG	A 32-bit (4-byte) signed (twos-complement) integer.
	10 = SRATIONAL	Two SLONGâ€™s: the first represents the numerator of a fraction, the second the denominator.
	11 = FLOAT	Single precision (4-byte) IEEE format.
	12 = DOUBLE	Double precision (8-byte) IEEE format.
From [BIGTIFFDESIGN]:
	13 = IFD	?? 32-bit unsigned integer offset value ??
	14 = UNICODE	??
	15 = COMPLEX	??
	16 = LONG8	64-bit unsigned integer.
	17 = SLONG8	64-bit signed integer.
	18 = IFD8	64-bit unsigned integer offset value

Default set of Field types
  1-12:  Field types 1 - 12 are described in [TIFF6].
  13-15: Field Type IDs 13 - 15 are mentioned in [BIGTIFFDESIGN], but only to
         explain why values 13 - 15 were skipped when identifying new Field Types
         for BigTIFF. These are meant to be used with regular TIFF, but were
         apparently not properly documented prior to the BigTIFF design
         discussion.
  16-18: Field Type IDs 16 - 18 were added for use with BigTIFF in [BIGTIFFDESIGN].
